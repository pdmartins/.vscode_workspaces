scenario: "Ambiguous request — configure project"
evaluation_type: routing
difficulty: hard

user_message: "configura o projeto"

context:
  project_stack: ["dotnet", "8.0"]
  has_copilot_project: false
  existing_files: ["src/Api/Api.csproj"]

expected_skills:
  - name: project-setup-bootstrap
    must_activate: true
    reason: "No .copilot-project configured — bootstrap is the right action"
  - name: code-program-configure
    must_activate: false
    reason: "Without more context, project setup takes priority over Program.cs configuration"

notes: |
  This is intentionally ambiguous. The agent should either:
  1. Ask for clarification (acceptable)
  2. Choose project-setup-bootstrap based on missing .copilot-project (preferred)
  The key test is that it does NOT jump to code-program-configure without asking.
