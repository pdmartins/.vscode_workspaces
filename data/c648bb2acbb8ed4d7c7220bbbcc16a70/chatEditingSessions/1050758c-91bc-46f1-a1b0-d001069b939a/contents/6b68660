# Chat Memory

Persistent storage for chat session state across machines.

Each file represents a chat session with its working context, progress, and next steps. Files are synced via git, enabling seamless handoff between machines.

## File Naming

`YYYY-MM-DD_{topic-in-kebab-case}.md`

## Lifecycle

- Sessions are saved manually (`agent-chat-save`) or auto-saved after `agent-task-manage` completes all tasks
- Sessions are resumed manually (`agent-chat-resume`) — "retoma sessão"
- All sessions are kept as permanent history
