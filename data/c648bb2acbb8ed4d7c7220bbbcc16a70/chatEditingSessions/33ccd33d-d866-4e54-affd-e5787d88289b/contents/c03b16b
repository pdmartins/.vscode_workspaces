# Commit Message Instructions

## Format

Single line only, using Conventional Commits:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

## Types (required)

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependencies, configs
- `ci`: CI/CD changes
- `build`: Build system or external dependencies

## Rules

1. Always include a type - it is mandatory
2. Single line only - no body or footer
3. Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
4. Don't capitalize the first letter of description
5. No period at the end
6. **Keep under 250 characters total**
7. **Description must summarize ALL changes being committed**
8. Scope is optional but recommended
9. Write in English
